===============Welcome to you in this simple guide that may help you in reacting with our program===============

Follow these steps sequentially:

1.  Use python environment program or Command Prompt CMD after installing python 3.12,
    you can download it from this hyperlink "https://www.python.org/downloads/" to execute TEA_1212508.py file.

    For environment program:
        Click RUN button and react with screen of it...

    For CMD:
        Write "cd path_of_project_folder" replace path_of_project_folder with actual path of this project folder,
        then click ENTER.
        Write "python TEA_1212508.py" then click ENTER.
        Now your program executing...

2.  Choose the mode of operation between two modes Electronic Codebook ECB or Cipher Block Chaining CBC or Exit.

3.  When ECB chosen, choose what you want Encryption or Decryption or Exit from mode.
    3.1.  Enter the key value such that it must be 32 characters of hexadecimal format!

    3.2.  For Encryption option:
            Choose between plaintext or picture.
            For plaintext:
                Enter plaintext you want to encrypt and the ciphertext result will be shown,
                and you can copy it in your own notepad.

            For picture:
                Enter your picture path and after encryption it,
                the encrypted picture will be stored in folder called "encrypted" with name "encrypted_picture.bmp".

    3.3.  For Decryption option:
            Choose between ciphertext or picture.
            For ciphertext:
                Enter your ciphertext you want to decrypt and the plaintext result will be shown also.

            For picture:
                Enter your encrypted picture path and after decryption it,
                the decrypted picture will be stored in folder called "decrypted" with name "decrypted_picture.bmp".

4.  When CBC chosen, also choose what you want Encryption or Decryption option or Exit from mode.
    4.1.  Enter the key value such that it must be 32 characters of hexadecimal format!

    4.2.  For Encryption option:
            Enter the Initialization Vector IV value such that it must be 16 characters of hexadecimal format!

            Choose between plaintext or picture.
            For plaintext:
                Enter plaintext you want to encrypt and the ciphertext result will be shown,
                and you can copy it in your own notepad.

            For picture:
                Enter your picture path and after encryption it,
                the encrypted picture will be stored in folder called "encrypted" with name "encrypted_picture.bmp".

    4.3.  For Decryption option:
            Choose between ciphertext or picture.
            For ciphertext:
                Enter your ciphertext you want to decrypt and the plaintext result will be shown also.

            For picture:
                Enter your encrypted picture path and after decryption it,
                the decrypted picture will be stored in folder called "decrypted" with name "decrypted_picture.bmp".
